üß† MirrorOrg MVP
AI-Powered Organizational Psychology Analyst
Discover hidden patterns and risks from your team's communication data.

</div>

<br>

MirrorOrg is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that acts as an AI organizational psychologist. It analyzes a team's communication history (e.g., from KakaoTalk, Slack) to diagnose interaction patterns, systemic risks, and individual communication styles, ultimately generating a comprehensive "1-Page Diagnostic Report."

This project explores the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM) not just as a data processor, but as a specialized expert persona capable of providing deep, qualitative insights.

‚ú® Key Features
üí¨ Chat Log Analysis: Upload and analyze .txt chat logs from platforms like KakaoTalk or Slack.

ü§ñ AI Psychologist Persona: The analysis is performed by "Dr. Aiden," an AI persona designed as an expert organizational psychologist, ensuring consistent and insightful reports.

üìÑ 1-Page Diagnostic Report: Generates a single, easy-to-read Markdown report that includes:

Identity Coefficient Map: Quantifies each member's communication style across 5 dimensions (Emotion, Cognition, Expression, Value, Bias) and defines their core role.

Systemic Risk Assessment: Identifies structural risks like communication bottlenecks or emotional burnout.

Actionable Recommendations: Provides concrete suggestions to improve team resilience and effectiveness.

üåê Bilingual Support: The entire user interface and the final analysis report can be toggled between English and Korean.

üöÄ How to Use
Select Language: Choose your preferred language (English/Korean) in the sidebar.

Upload File: Upload your .txt chat log file.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Design Philosophy
Framework: Streamlit

Core Logic: Python

AI & Language Model: OpenAI API (GPT-4o)

Core Design Principle: Instead of forcing the LLM to generate potentially unstable JSON data, we leverage its strength in writing expert reports. This approach minimizes complex error handling, enhances system reliability, and maximizes the readability of the final output.
