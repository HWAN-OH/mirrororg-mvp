🧠 MirrorOrg MVP
AI-Powered Organizational Psychology Analyst

MirrorOrg is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that acts as an AI organizational psychologist. It analyzes a team's communication history (e.g., chat logs) to diagnose interaction patterns, systemic risks, and individual communication styles, ultimately generating a comprehensive 1-page diagnostic report.

This project demonstrates how a Large Language Model (LLM) can be utilized not just as a data processor, but as a specialized expert persona to provide deep, qualitative insights.

✨ Key Features
💬 Chat Log Analysis: Upload raw text files of chat logs (e.g., from KakaoTalk, Slack) to be analyzed.

🤖 AI Psychologist Persona: The analysis is performed by "Dr. Aiden," an AI persona designed as an expert organizational psychologist, ensuring consistent and insightful reports.

📄 1-Page Markdown Report: Generates a single, easy-to-read diagnostic report in Markdown format, which includes:

Identity Coefficient Map: Quantifies each member's communication style across 5 dimensions (Emotion, Cognition, Expression, Value, Bias) and defines their core role.

Systemic Risk Assessment: Identifies structural risks like communication bottlenecks or emotional burnout.

Actionable Recommendations: Provides concrete suggestions to improve team resilience and effectiveness.

🌐 Bilingual Support: The entire user interface and the final analysis report can be toggled between Korean and English.

🚀 How to Use
Select Language: Choose your preferred language (Korean/English) in the sidebar.

Upload File: Upload a .txt chat log file.

Generate Report: Click the "Generate Analysis Report" button.

Get Insights: Review the AI-generated 1-page report directly in the app.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
Framework: Streamlit

Core Logic: Python

AI & Language Model: OpenAI API (GPT-4o)

Key Design Principle: The application is architected to be simple and robust. Instead of forcing the LLM to generate structured data like JSON (which can be unstable), we prompt it to act as an expert and write a complete, formatted report—a task it excels at. This minimizes complex parsing and error handling, making the system more reliable.
